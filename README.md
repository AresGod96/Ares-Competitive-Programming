# Problem Solving Resources :computer:
:trophy: A collection of algorithm libraries and problem solution, consisting of my code and snippets during our training for competitive programming. Problems mainly come from online judges and problem-solving contests such as
- [**ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)**](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/)
- [**Codeforces**](https://codeforces.com)
- [**VNOJ**](https://oj.vnoi.info/)
- [**Baekjoon OJ**](https://acmicpc.net)
- [**SPhere Online Judge**](https://spoj.com)
- [**HackerRank**](https://hackerrank.com)
- [**CodeChef**](https://codechef.com)

There are also problems from other competitions such as [**Google Code Jam**](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [**Facebook Hacker Cup**](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup), etc..
