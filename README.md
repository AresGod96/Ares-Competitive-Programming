# Competitive Programming Library :computer:
An algorithm library consists of my own code and templates, as well as examples for training Competitive Programming. Problems mainly come from
- [**ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)**](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/)
- [**Codeforces**](https://codeforces.com)
- [**SPhere Online Judge**](https://spoj.com)
- [**HackerRank**](https://hackerrank.com)
- [**CodeChef**](https://codechef.com)

There are also problems from other competitions such as [**Google Code Jam**](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [**Facebook Hacker Cup**](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup), etc..

To be updated.
