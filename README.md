Contains all of my code for projects and competitive programming stuff. Problems mainly come from

- [**Codeforces**](https://codeforces.com)
- [**SPhere Online Judge**](https://spoj.com)
- [**HackerRank**](https://hackerrank.com)

There are also other contests such as [**Google Code Jam**](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), [**Facebook Hacker Cup**](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup), etc..
