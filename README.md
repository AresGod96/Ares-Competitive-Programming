A collection of algorithm libraries, consisting of my code and snippets during our training for Competitive Programming. Problems mainly come from
- [**ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)**](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/)
- [**Codeforces**](https://codeforces.com)
- [**SPhere Online Judge**](https://spoj.com)
- [**HackerRank**](https://hackerrank.com)
